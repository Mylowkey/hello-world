Emilio Malca
Hi!, My name is Emilio, I'm a creative mind with a big advocate for problem-solving, analytical thinking, and modern technology.

My activator brain is always on the move, looking for something to do on a daily, one of those things is solutions. I try not to rush into those...

I have a Bachelor's degree and 5+ years of professional experience in customer service, sales, and videography.

I have been involved with the complete design process, from conceptualization to delivery. I can adapt to all phases of a project life-cycle.
